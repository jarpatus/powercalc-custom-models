# powercalc-custom-models
PowerCalc (Home Assistant custom component) custom model library for (my) devices not having unique product name and thus won't be accepted as part of official PowerCal model library (rightfully so). Tuya, Ledvance etc. devices which uses either generic product name or uniquish name but still the same name for multiple products in the offering.
